nested object

nested-object is an object inside of another object.
Allows you to represent more complex data structures
Child object is enclosed by a Parent object
for example, Person{ Address{}, ContactInfo{} }
ShoppingCart{ Keyboard{}, Mouse{}, Monitor{} }

example1

1. create an object

const person = {
    fullName: "Antonia Porsild",
    age: 27,
    isStudent: true,
    hobbies: ["karate", "boxing", "cooking"],
    address: {
        street: "Pahol Yothin",
        city: "Bangkok",
        country: "Thailand"
    }
}

console.log(person.fullName);
console.log(person.age);
console.log(person.isStudent);
console.log(person.hobbies[0]);
console.log(person.address.city);


2. we can use for loop
const person = {
    fullName: "Antonia Porsild",
    age: 27,
    isStudent: true,
    hobbies: ["karate", "boxing", "cooking"],
    address: {
        street: "Pahol Yothin",
        city: "Bangkok",
        country: "Thailand"
    }
}

for(const property in person.address){
    console.log(person.address[property]);
}


result:
Pahol Yothin
Bangkok
Thailand



example2

1. create a class and a constructor inside a class

class Address{
    constructor(street, city, country){
        this.street = street;
        this.city = city;
        this.country = country;
    }
}


2. Now, create another class that also has a constructor
3. we use rest parameter to pass variable into an array

class Person{
    constructor(name, age, ...address){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        //we're going to call the constructor of our address class
        //and pass in our address by utilizing the spread operator to spread our address
        //we'll send our address object which are street, city, country
        this.address = new Address(...address);
    }
}


class Address{
    constructor(street, city, country){
        this.street = street;
        this.city = city;
        this.country = country;
    }
}


4. create some instances

class Person{
    constructor(name, age, ...address){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        //we're going to call the constructor of our address class
        //and pass in our address by utilizing the spread operator to spread our address
        //we'll send our address object which are street, city, country
        this.address = new Address(...address);
    }
}


class Address{
    constructor(street, city, country){
        this.street = street;
        this.city = city;
        this.country = country;
    }
}


//create some instance
const person1 = new Person("Antonia", 27, "Pahol Yothin", "Bangkok","Thailand")

const person2 = new Person("Patrick", 37, "128 Conch St.","Bikini Bottom", "Int. Waters");

const person3 = new Person(" Squidward", 45, "126 Conch St.", "Bikini Bottom", "Int. Waters");


console.log(person3.address);



result:
Address {
  street: '126 Conch St.',
  city: 'Bikini Bottom',  
  country: 'Int. Waters'  
}
