spread operator allows an iterable such as an array or string 
to be expanded in to separate elements

In other word, spread operator helps us unpack the elements into an individual element.

example 1
if we need to find the maximum number in an array by using Math.max() method

#file Start.js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let max = Math.max(numbers);
console.log(max);

result: NaN

We get NaN as a result because we canâ€™t place an array directly within this method.

However by utilizing the spread operator, we can unpack the array to an individual element

#file Start.js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let max = Math.max(...numbers);
console.log(max);

or
#file Start.js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let max = Math.max(...numbers);
let min = Math.min(...numbers);
console.log(max);
console.log(min);


example 2
let username = "Anntonia";
let letters = [...username];
console.log(letters);

////we got an array of alphabets


example 3
We can combine 2 arrays by using spread operator.

#file Start.js
let fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana"];
let vegetables = ["carrots", "celery", "potatoes"];

let food = [...fruits, ...vegetables, 'eggs', 'milk'];
console.log(food)
