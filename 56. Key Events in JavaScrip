1. eventListener

2. In this section, we’ll discuss about:
      1. keydown occurs when you press down on a key.
      2. keyup occurs when you release a key.
      3. keypress but this event is incompatible with web browser, 
      so we should avoid using this.

3. to add event listener you’ll use 
      .addEventListener(event type, callback)
