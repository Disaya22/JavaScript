VS code : you will need a text-editor
one text editor we use is VS code

folder structure: we’ll begin at least 3 files: index.html style.css and start.js.
we can link an external style sheet to our HTML file within the link tag. There is a relationship attribute shortened to rel.
The relationship will be stylesheet, we are linking a stylesheet, 
then we need the href attribute where the CSS file is located. 
If the CSS file is located within the same folder, we only need the file’s name.
Finally, we need to link the JavaScript file to our HTML file via a pair of script tag, 
then we will set the source to be the name of the JS file.

live server extension in VS code which makes the web page refresh automatically when we save any changes to our file
right click at our html file, and click open with live server

You should make your script element be able at the bottom of the body of your document
just in case there’s an error with your JS file, you do want all of the HTML elements to at least render first before running js code

console.log(): to output some text, you type console.log(), 
you can use double quotes, single quotes or backticks.
Go to your web page -> inspects -> console to see the result.
