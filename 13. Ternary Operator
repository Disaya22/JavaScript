ternary operator is a shortcut to if statements.
It helps to assign a variable based on a condition.

condition ? codeIfTrue : codeIfFalse;


#file Start.js
let time = 9;
let greeting = time < 12 ? "Good morning!" : "Good afternoon!";
console.log(greeting);

let time = 9;
let greeting;
if (){}
else{};
console.log(greeting);

let isStudent = false;
let message = isStudent ? "You are a student" : "You are NOT a student";
console.log(message);

let purchaseAmount = 99;
let discount = purchaseAmount >= 100 ? 10 : 0;
console.log(`Your total is $${purchaseAmount - purchaseAmount * (discount/100)}`);
