1. DOM stands for Document Object Model
2. It’s a JS object that represents the page you see in the web browser 
and provides you with an API to interact with it.
3. Web browser constructs the DOM when it loads an HTML document, 
and structures all the elements in a tree-like representation
4. within our HTML document we have our HTML elements as the root element 
5. HTML element contains a head element and a body element ( and may be many various elements)
6. we can access the element by its ID => document.getElementById(“---”)
7. our document is an object, so it can contains properties and methods and other nested objects
8. we can use console.dir(document) ; meaning directory, this will list all of the properties of this object


9. JavaScript can access the DOM to dynamically change the content, 
structure, and style of a web page

#file index.html
html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p id="message">Welcome </p>
    <script src="index.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

JavaScript
const username = "";
const welcomeMesssage = document.getElementById("message");

welcomeMesssage.textContent += username === "" ? "Guest" : username;
