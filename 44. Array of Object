1. create an array of object

#file start.js
const fruits = [ {name: "apple", color: "red", calories: 95},
                 {name: "orange", color: "orange", calories: 45},
                 {name: "banana", color: "yellow", calories: 105},
                 {name: "coconut", color: "white", calories: 159},
                 {name: "pineapple", color: "yellow", calories: 37}];



2. Access object property

console.log(fruits)
console.log(fruits[0].color);



3. Add a new fruit object using push() method

fruits.push({name:"grapes", color:"purple", calories: 62})
console.log(fruits);



4. Remove the last fruit object using pop() method
this should remove the last object, pineapple

fruits.pop();
console.log(fruits)



5. Remove the specified fruit object using splice() method
delete from x to y

fruits.splice(1,3);
console.log(fruits);

result:
apple and pineapple



6. applied forEach() method

fruits.forEach( fruit => console.log(fruit));
fruits.forEach( fruit => console.log("ไพลินชอบกิน " + fruit.name));



7. applied map() method which return a new array

// map(): potato => french fried
// map(): chicken => chicken pie

const fruitsName = fruits.map(fruit => fruit.name);
const fruitsCalories = fruits.map(fruit => fruit.calories);

console.log(fruitsName)
console.log(fruitsCalories);



8. applied filter() mathod
filter() returns a new array after using each element
and checking a condition

const yellowFruits = fruits.filter(fruit => fruit.color === "yellow");
console.log(yellowFruits);

const lowCalorie = fruits.filter(fruit => fruit.calories < 100);
console.log(lowCalorie);



9. applied reduce() method
reduce() method will return a single value
in this case, it'll return an object, one of these object


example1
//ex. return the object with the greatest amount of calories
//and store in const Max


const Max = fruits.reduce((current, elem) => { 
    //let count=0;
    //if
    return elem.calories > current.calories ? elem : current
});
console.log(Max);

    //current is our accumulator, or temporary result, which default value is zero
    //and keeps track of the greatest value during each iteration,
    //it'll be the current record holder of the object with the greatest amount of calories
    
    //elem is the next element, in this case element means "each element of fruits array"
