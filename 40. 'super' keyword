1. super is a keyword that used in classes to call the constructor 
or access the properties and methods of a parent 
(the parent is also known as the superclass)

2. 'this' refers to this object
3. 'super' refers to the parent of that object

set up

1. create a superclass and its subclasses.
#file start.js

//superclass
class Animal{
    alive = true;
    eat(){
        console.log("This " + this.name + " is eating")
    }
    sleep(){
        console.log("This " + this.name + " is sleeping")
    }
}

//subclass
class Reptile extends Animal{
}

class Fish extends Animal{
}

class Mammal extends Animal{
}


super constructor
2. we’ll add an empty constructor for Animal class
3. and then add a constructor for the Reptile, Fish and Mammal class
4. so, they will have a name, age and speed as  properties
5. and we will assign these properties within the constructor like 
this.name = the name that we receive

#file start.js
//superclass
class Animal{
    constructor(){}
}

//subclass
class Reptile extends Animal{
    constructor(name, age, crawlSpeed){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.crawlSpeed = crawlSpeed;
    }
}

class Fish extends Animal{
    constructor(name, age, swimSpeed){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.swimSpeed = swimSpeed;
    }
}

class Mammal extends Animal{
    constructor(name, age, runSpeed){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.runSpeed = runSpeed;
    }
}


6. create some object

#file start.js
//superclass
class Animal{
    constructor(){}
}

//subclass
class Reptile extends Animal{
    constructor(name, age, crawlSpeed){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.crawlSpeed = crawlSpeed;
    }
}

class Fish extends Animal{
    constructor(name, age, swimSpeed){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.swimSpeed = swimSpeed;
    }
}

class Mammal extends Animal{
    constructor(name, age, runSpeed){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.runSpeed = runSpeed;
    }
}

//create some object
const rabbit = new Mammal("rabbit", 1, 25);
const shark = new Fish("shark", 3, 45);
const python = new Reptile("python", 5, 15);

7. when we run this program, we have an uncaught reference error:  
must call super constructor in derived class before accessing the this keyword 
8. before we can use the this keyword, we have to call the constructor 
of the parent (superclass) 
9. we will invoke the constructor of the parent(the superclass) 
with the super keyword within each of these respective constructors

10. like this one

#file start.js
class Reptile extends Animal{
    constructor(name, age, crawlSpeed){
        super();
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.crawlSpeed = crawlSpeed;
    }
}


11. One of the benefits of using constructors is that if there’s any properties 
that the children all share in common. 
we can send them to the constructor of the parent
12. and we do need to pass in these arguments to the parent constructor

#file start.js
//superclass
class Animal{
    constructor(name, age){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}


//subclass
class Reptile extends Animal{
    constructor(name, age, crawlSpeed){
        super(name, age);
        this.crawlSpeed = crawlSpeed;
    }
}


class Fish extends Animal{
    constructor(name, age, swimSpeed){
        super(name, age);
        this.swimSpeed = swimSpeed;
    }
}


class Mammal extends Animal{
    constructor(name, age, runSpeed){
        super(name, age);
        this.runSpeed = runSpeed;
    }
}


//create some object
const rabbit = new Mammal("rabbit", 1, 25);
const shark = new Fish("shark", 3, 45);
const python = new Reptile("python", 5, 15);


13. let’s test this to see if it works

//file index.html
//superclass
class Animal{
    constructor(name, age){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}

//subclass
class Reptile extends Animal{
    constructor(name, age, crawlSpeed){
        super(name, age);
        this.crawlSpeed = crawlSpeed;
    }
}

class Fish extends Animal{
    constructor(name, age, swimSpeed){
        super(name, age);
        this.swimSpeed = swimSpeed;
    }
}

class Mammal extends Animal{
    constructor(name, age, runSpeed){
        super(name, age);
        this.runSpeed = runSpeed;
    }
}

//create some object
const rabbit = new Mammal("rabbit", 1, 25);
const shark = new Fish("shark", 3, 45);
const python = new Reptile("python", 5, 15);

//let’s test this to see if it works
console.log(rabbit.name);
console.log(rabbit.age);
console.log(rabbit.runSpeed);

rabbit
1
25


SUMMARY

14. this is how we can use the super keyword in a class to call the constructor 
of the parent. It helps code reusability. any properties that the children share 
in common, the constructor of the parent can take care it so that we don’t have to
repeat the set of code every single time for each child, we write it in one place 
and reuse it.

15. super method
    1. another thing we can do too with the super keyword is extending a method from the parent => super method
    2. we will create a method in our parent class

    #file start.js
//superclass
class Animal{
    constructor(name, age){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    //we will create a method in our parent class
    move(speed){
        console.log(`The ${this.name} moves at a speed of ${speed}mph`)
    }
}

    3. within each of these children classes, we’re going to extend the move method of the parent class inside method of our children classes like this
    4. using super dot method of parent class

    #file start.js

//superclass
class Animal{
    constructor(name, age){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }


    //we will create a method in our parent class
    move(speed){
        console.log(`The ${this.name} moves at a speed of ${speed} mph`)
    }
}


//subclass
class Reptile extends Animal{
    constructor(name, age, crawlSpeed){
        super(name, age);
        this.crawlSpeed = crawlSpeed;
    }


    crawl(){
        console.log("This " + this.name + " can crawl");
        super.move(this.crawlSpeed);


    }


}


class Fish extends Animal{
    constructor(name, age, swimSpeed){
        super(name, age);
        this.swimSpeed = swimSpeed;
    }


    swim(){
        console.log("This " + this.name + " can swim");
        super.move(this.swimSpeed);


    }


}


class Mammal extends Animal{
    constructor(name, age, runSpeed){
        super(name, age);
        this.runSpeed = runSpeed;
    }


    run(){
        console.log("This " + this.name + " can run");
        super.move(this.runSeed);
    }


}


//create some object
const rabbit = new Mammal("rabbit", 1, 25);
const shark = new Fish("shark", 3, 45);
const python = new Reptile("python", 5, 15);


//let’s test this to see if it works
shark.swim();


result:
This shark can swim
The shark moves at a speed of 45 mph
